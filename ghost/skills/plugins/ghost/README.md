1. Open Claude Code in your repository:

   cd /path/to/your/repo
   claude
   ```

2. Install the skills plugin if not already installed (see above).

3. Build repository context (recommended before scanning):
   ```
   /ghost-repo-context       # Build a shared repository context used by all the scan skills
   ```

4. Run scans to understand the security posture of your repository:
   ```
   /ghost-scan-deps     # Exploitability analysis of dependency vulnerabilities (SCA)
   /ghost-scan-secrets  # Context assessment of detected secrets and credentials 
   /ghost-scan-code     # AI-powered detection of code security issues (SAST)
   ```

5. Generate a combined security report:
   ```
   /ghost-report        # Combined security report across all scan results
   ```

6. Validate findings against a live application:
   ```
   /ghost-validate      # Dynamic/live validation against a live application (DAST)
   ```
